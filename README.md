# tictactoe # beginner # Javascript

This is my first ever project made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS

The project helped me with designing using css , DOM Manipulation and Game logic building. 

index.html contains components created using html
style.css contains styling of the components
main.js contains the actual logic for the game 

Try finding the flow on your own which will help you learn more about the logic building part , just give it a try!

I have done the same thing in while building this project

hope you enjoyed this project 

Thank You!
